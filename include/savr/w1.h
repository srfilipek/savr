     * @brief 64-bit 1-Wire device address type

     * Internally, the address is stored in proper bit order in a 64bit
     * unsigned integer. This results in the 8-byte address ordering, when
     * accessed through the array field, to be:
     *   Field: [ CRC | 48-bit serial | Family ]
     *   Index:    7     6 5 4 3 2 1      0
     *
     * The ordering of bytes is a consequence of GCC's implementation of this
     * systems "endianness".
     *
     * The PrintAddress() function prints the hexadecimal characters in proper
     * address order, from 7 down to 0, to match the above field order.
