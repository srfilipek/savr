/**
 * @file wdt.h
 *
 * @brief Watchdog interface
 *
 * Watchdog interface that provides lightweight utility functions for
 * interacting with the built-in watchdog system.
 *
 * IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
 *
 * This interface deviates from recommended practice for size considerations.
 *
 * First, no interrupt protection is performed. The caller is responsible for
 * disabling and re-enabling interrupts if needed before calling configure()
 * or off().
 *
 * Second, we do not attempt to maintain the current watchdog value when
 * modifying the configuration. This may cause a timeout during the operation.
 * This can be avoided by kicking the watchdog manually betfore calling
 * configure() or off(), if this is a concern.
